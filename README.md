# Capstone Design Project â€“ Wireless Battery Management System (wBMS)

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This repository contains my Capstone Design project, where we designed and implemented a **Bluetooth-based Wireless Battery Management System (wBMS)** using an **ESP32-D board**. The project integrates hardware, firmware, and simulations to manage and monitor battery health efficiently.

## ðŸŽ“ Notes

This project is part of my **Undergraduate Capstone Design study** in Electrical Engineering.  
It reflects not only the technical aspects but also my **story of learning and building**.

## ðŸš€ Future Work?

- Expand to multi-cell battery packs  
- Add cloud dashboard for real-time monitoring  
- Improve SOC estimation accuracy with machine learning
